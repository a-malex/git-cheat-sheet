# Git Cheat Sheet

## Introduction
Here I collect useful information and comands of **git** that use every day in technical life. Hope to be helpful for you.

- **version control systems:** it allows us to contribute to projects whith no limitation on location.Also, it helps us to control our code from the first day and fix or reset our code easily.
- **repository:** It's a directory of your project. LICENSE, README and .gitignore are the important files.
- **main README parts:** LICENSE, README and .gitignore
- **git clone:** saves a full copy of our repository on our local machine.
- **git pull:** update our local repo with remote
- **git reset:** set the current branch "head" to "commit" that is specified and change the log.
- **git revert:** is used to record some new commits to reverse the effect of some earlier commits from a specified "head".
- **git checkout:** restore a file to a specific version also, change branch.
- **git merge:** replay the changes made on the named branch to the current branch from when they diverged.
- **git rebase:** a process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit and rewrite history.
- **git log:** used to see commits' history
- **git diff:** used to see a file's changes
- **git tag:** It's versioning. git tag -a v0.1 -m "first version" 
- **the processes of contributing a project:** we should fork the project then add our codes to the project then make a pull request.
- **branches:**  A pointer to a snapshot of our changes, when we want to add a new feature or fix a bug or something like that we create a branch and work on it.
 git merge "branch"
